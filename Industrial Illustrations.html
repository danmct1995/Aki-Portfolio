  <h1> Illustrations For An Industrial Technology Company </h1>
  <p> For this project, I was asked to create two illustrations for an industrial technology company. The goal of the
    first illustration was to show how the new software is easier to use than their old one. The goal of the second
    illustration was to depict three different factories in a landscape setting; A refinery, papermill, and an
    industrial plant. </p>

  <h2> Client Review </h2>
  <p> "Aki was a wonderful designer to collaborate with. She's talented, knows how to work with feedback, and is a great
    listener. Our end result was spot on what we were needing, and I'm excited to have a chance to work with her again
    in the future."

    I went about implementing them. </div>

  <p> -Add a header area to each of the two chart sides. </p>
  <p> -Right Monitor: flip horizontally so the woman looks like she's facing to the right instead. </p>
  <p> -Give the woman a hard hat and a factory outfit to show she's an industrial worker. </p>

    <p> -Delete the lightning bolts on the very right factory, so it won't be interpreted as a nuclear powerplant. </p>
    <p> -Make the very left factory look like a refinery. </p>
    <p> -Bring in the following: A train going into the left plant, a truck next to the middle plant, and a ship (on a
      river) right besides the plant. </p>
